I've spent the last couple of days dabbling in Go. To provide some context, I quite like the concept of building a 'second brain' through documentation and notes & have been doing so for over a year. So, I decided to build a small CLI tool that generates a note in a predefined structure using the OpenAI API, based on the 'thought' that comes into my head.

This idea stems from:
1. The desire to not have to leave my normal workflow in the terminal.
2. The elimination of context switching.

It's not perfect, but it serves as a solid starting block. Plus, it's been fun to mess around in a language I don't use too often!
