Hi :wave: , I'm Matt, if you hadn't of guessed.

I'm a 27 year old software developer from the North West of England. 
As the tag on the front page says, I like software, systems, sports & simpsons. _I'm still yet to find a scenario I can't respond with a simpsons gif too._

I've loved sport since I was kid, most side projects I've started in the last couple of years have been sport related.
Mainly as of late my attempt at creating an **FPL** type **MMA** game, and creating an app which sends me an SMS over twilio with trending players being transferred in & out in standard **FPL**.
I will write more on them individually in the future, I promise.

In the software development world, I'm a huge advocate for Test Driven Development. I'm also a big fan of improving the teams development process as much as possible,
mainly by writing automated scripts or creating some tooling, we are developers after all.
I've wrote PHP professionally for the last 5 years and compared to the majority of things you'd likely to read on the internet, I actually enjoy it.
